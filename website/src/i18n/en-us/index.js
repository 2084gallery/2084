  explorer: 'The purpose of 2084 Gallery resides in its commitment towards individuals invested body and soul in the discovery and preservation of our heritage. The club will gather a myriad of devoted, open-minded, curious and inquisitive profiles. It is through benevolence and recognition that we will write together a chapter of our common history. Within this intimate space, a humble tribute to genuine luxury at its most virtuous, we will forge projects to shape the future. In a secret garden suspended in time and preserved from the surrounding frenzy, the richness of our humanities will be celebrated. <br> 2084 Gallery will present itself as an ecosystem dedicated the prestige and genius of the hand, the fruit of men and women around the world who stand up against the excesses of globalisation and technological disruptions. Akin to explorers, club members will discover Western know-how in four unique spheres, physical and spiritual spaces named houses of exploration that will be home to dedicated academies. <br> . House of European Ateliers <br> . House of Creation <br>. House of Oenology and Spirits <br> . House of Mixology and Pastry'
