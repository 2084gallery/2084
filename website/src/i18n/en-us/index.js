  explorer: '2084 Gallery will present itself as a private club dedicated to excellence and the genius of the hand, the fruit of the heritage of men and women around the world who stand up against certain excesses of globalization and digital technology. Like explorers, club members will discover Western know-how in four spaces, physical and spiritual places called houses of exploration. Within these intimate spaces, in homage to true luxury in its most virtuous, we will forge projects to shape the future. <br/> In this international institution we will discover and preserve the richness of our heritage.',
